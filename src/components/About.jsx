      <p>
        I started learning web development from TheOdinProject.
        <br />
        Working on personal and learning projects since January 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I am not working or learning, I enjoy relaxing through playing video games, reading books, and watching sports (NFL/NBA).
